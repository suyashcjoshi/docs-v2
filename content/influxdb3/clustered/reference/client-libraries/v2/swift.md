    ### Use InfluxDB 3 clients

    The `/api/v2/query` API endpoint and associated tooling, such as InfluxDB v2 client libraries and the `influx` CLI, **can't** query an {{% product-name omit=" Clustered" %}} cluster.

    [InfluxDB 3 client libraries](/influxdb3/clustered/reference/client-libraries/v3/) and [Flight SQL clients](/influxdb3/clustered/reference/client-libraries/) are available that integrate with your code to write and query data stored in {{% product-name %}}.

    InfluxDB 3 supports many different tools for [**writing**](/influxdb3/clustered/write-data/) and [**querying**](/influxdb3/clustered/query-data/) data.
    [**Compare tools you can use**](/influxdb3/clustered/get-started/#tools-to-use) to interact with {{% product-name %}}.
